# TechKnAcq Data

Output files can be saved here to be used in concept graph generation:
- alt-dt.txt: Alternative document-topic weights, as generated by
  `score-doc-topics.py`.
- alledge.tsv: Concept-to-concept dependency weights, generated by
  TechKnAcq-core (as called by `build-corpus`). To save this output from
  `build-corpus`, comment out the line that deletes the output file.
- pedagogical-roles.txt: The pedagogical roles of documents, as generated
  by Emily Sheng's (separate) code.
